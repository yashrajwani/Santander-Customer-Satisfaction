# Santander-Customer-Satisfaction

 From frontline support teams to C-suites, customer satisfaction is a key measure of success. Unhappy customers don't stick around. What's more, unhappy customers rarely voice their dissatisfaction before leaving.

 In this project, we work with hundreds of anonymized features to predict if a customer is satisfied or dissatisfied with their banking experience.

 The task is to predict the probability of each customer in the test set being unsatisfied.
